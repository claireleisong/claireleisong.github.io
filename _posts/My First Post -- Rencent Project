Last month, I did a fun project and the main topic of my project is the comparison of MPC solution and high fidelity simulation for magnetic levitating ball.
 
Magnetic Levitation lead low losses energy from friction. In addition, lower the energy cost of controlling this system promoted the eﬃciency of energy consuming. Therefore, Model Predict Control (MPC) is introduced to lower energy cost when controlling this system. This resulting project reveals the gap between Model Predict Control (MPC) solution and high ﬁdelity simulation. To perform MPC solution on a real system may not achieve aimed goal. In this simulation, two cases are contradicted to future position estimation of Runge-Kutta Fehlberg with 4th and 5th order method. More speciﬁc, too many state and input nodes applied in one MPC model cause distortion when this model put too much weight on cost function. To be controlled exactly, lower the penalty weighting constraints will lead to better reference tracking.
